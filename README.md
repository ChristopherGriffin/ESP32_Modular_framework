# ESP32_Modular_framework

This is a framework to support Serial, Wifi, OTA, MQTT and NTP time.
It is a starting place I use to take care of the basics of beginning of an automation project cutting down on initial work.

Apply constants in A2
Add pins functions in A3
Add MQTT messages in A4
Start your new code in B0_XXXX
